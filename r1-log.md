# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Martin Lanser]

This is the official log for the 1st part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 15, Friday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 - 15MAY2020
* Set up work environment on CodeAnywhere and link to Github repo.
* Started Python refresher based on "[The Python Apprentice](http://leanpub.com/python-apprentice)" book by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham
* Hoping to get through most of the book in next few days so that I can tackle a real application sometime next week.

### R1D2 - 16MAY2020
* More progress with Python refresher.
* Also taking sneak peek at the [Cement CLI framework](https://builtoncement.com/). Cement is very easy to install and seems to have great documentation and tutorials.
