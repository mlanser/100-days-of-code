This is the official log for the 1st part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 15, Friday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 - 15MAY2020
* Set up work environment on CodeAnywhere and link to Github repo.
* Started Python refresher based on "[The Python Apprentice](http://leanpub.com/python-apprentice)" book by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham
* Hoping to get through most of the book in next few days so that I can tackle a real application sometime next week.

### R1D2 - 16MAY2020
* More progress with Python refresher. Strings, bytes, lists, and dictionaries.
* Also taking sneak peek at the [Cement CLI framework](https://builtoncement.com/). Cement is very easy to install and seems to have great documentation and tutorials.

### R1D3 - 17MAY2020
* Yet more Python refresher - strings, collections, loops, and a bit of modularity :-)
* Played with loops and some trivial text processing.
* Played with functions and docstrings.
* Tried out executing sample app from both within Python environment and from CLI.

### R1D4 - 18MAY2020
* Yet more Python refresher - the Python object model, some more built-in collection types, variable scopes, and other fun :-|
* Played with loops and some trivial text processing.
* Checked out a few awesome Python packages recommended in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/tech-explained/top-15-python-packages-you-must-try-c6a877ed3cd0). 

### R1D5 - 19MAY2020
* More Python refresher - some exception handling in Python, some more built-in collection types, variable scopes, and other fun :-|
* Played mostly with exception handling.

### R1D6 - 20MAY2020
* More Python refresher - comprehensions, iteration protocols, and generator functions ... ugh :-(
* That's it ... brain still fried!

### R1D7 - 21MAY2020
* More Python refresher - revisiting comprehensions and some examples from yesterday. Still trying to wrap my head around this ... :-|
* Working with Python classes.

### R1D8 - 22MAY2020
* More Python refresher - classes and methods and inheritance ... that's it for today :-)

### R1D9 - 23MAY2020
* More Python refresher - more work and re-work using classes and methods and inheritance. Needed to get this straight in my head. :-)
* Also worked quite a bit with files - reading, writing, parsing, etc.

### R1D10 - 24MAY2020
* Yes, more Python refresher - a bit more on file operations.
* Trying out some unit testing ... yay! :-)
