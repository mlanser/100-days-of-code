## Goals &amp; Objectives:

The main objective is to learn more Python in general. I also want to learn how to use frameworks such as [Cement](https://builtoncement.com/) to create applications which will collect realtime sensor data from IoT devices built on/around [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) hardware.

## Project Description/Outline

* Freshen up basic Python skills
* Learn basics of Cement framework
* Create basic Cement applications
* Learn to read sensor data
* Create Cement application to read, store, and process sensor data
